# TimeScale

TimescaleDB is an open-source time-series database built on top of PostgreSQL, designed for efficiently storing and querying time-series data. 

It introduces the concept of hypertables, which automatically partition data by time and space, making it ideal for high-volume data scenarios like monitoring, IoT, and financial analytics. 

TimescaleDB combines the power of relational databases with the performance of a specialized time-series solution, offering advanced features like continuous aggregates, real-time analytics, and seamless integration with PostgreSQL's ecosystem.

It's a robust choice for developers looking to manage time-series data in scalable and efficient ways.
