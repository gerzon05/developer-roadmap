# AWS Neptune

AWS Neptune is a fully managed graph database service designed for applications that require highly connected data. 

It supports two popular graph models: Property Graph and RDF (Resource Description Framework), allowing you to build applications that traverse billions of relationships with millisecond latency. 

Neptune is optimized for storing and querying graph data, making it ideal for use cases like social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and knowledge graphs. 

It offers high availability, automatic backups, and multi-AZ (Availability Zone) replication, ensuring data durability and fault tolerance. 

Additionally, Neptune integrates seamlessly with other AWS services and supports open standards like Gremlin, SPARQL, and Apache TinkerPop, making it flexible and easy to integrate into existing applications.
